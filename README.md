# mlops-obesity-classifier

A hands-on MLOps starter project built around a logistic regression model that classifies obesity risk. This repo is the **prerequisite starting point** for the [MLOps Labs](#labs) — clone it, run it, then work through the labs to progressively add MLOps tooling.

---

## What this project does

Trains a logistic regression model on the [Obesity Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) to classify whether a person is obese (binary: 0/1). It achieves ~97% accuracy on the validation set.

The model pipeline is broken into three reusable modules:

| Module              | Responsibility                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/preprocess.py` | Load data, create binary target, split, one-hot encode |
| `src/train.py`      | Train logistic regression, save model as `.pkl`        |
| `src/evaluate.py`   | Compute accuracy/precision/recall, save `metrics.json` |

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rohitnayak/mlops-obesity-classifier.git
cd mlops-obesity-classifier

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Mac / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Train the model
python -m src.train

# 5. Evaluate the model
python -m src.evaluate

# 6. Run the test suite
pytest tests/ -v
```

After step 4 you'll have a trained model at `models/model.pkl`.
After step 5 you'll have evaluation results at `metrics.json`.
All tests in step 6 should pass. ✅

## Labs

The labs build progressively on this starter project, each introducing a new MLOps concept.

| Lab                                                | Topic                        | Key tools                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Lab 1](labs/lab-01-github-actions-ci.md)          | GitHub Actions — CI pipeline | GitHub Actions                |
| [Lab 2](labs/lab-02-mlflow-experiment-tracking.md) | Experiment tracking          | MLflow                        |
| [Lab 3](labs/lab-03-dvc-versioning.md)             | Data & model versioning      | DVC                           |
| [Lab 4](labs/lab-04-fastapi-model-serving.md)      | REST API model serving       | FastAPI                       |
| [Lab 5](labs/lab-05-docker-containerisation.md)    | Containerisation             | Docker                        |
| [Lab 6](labs/lab-06-advanced-cicd.md)              | Advanced CI/CD pipeline      | GitHub Actions + Docker Hub   |
| [Lab 7](labs/lab-07-full-mlops-pipeline.md)        | Full MLOps pipeline          | DVC + MLflow + GitHub Actions |

Start with [Lab 1](labs/lab-01-github-actions-ci.md).

## Branching strategy

`main` always reflects the latest completed lab — it moves forward as you work through the course.

Each completed lab is also saved as a permanent reference branch so you can see the exact state of the project at any point:

| Branch            | State                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`            | Starter project — prereqs complete, no labs started |
| `lab-01-solution` | After Lab 1: GitHub Actions CI pipeline             |
| `lab-02-solution` | After Lab 2: MLflow experiment tracking             |
| `lab-03-solution` | After Lab 3: DVC data & model versioning            |
| `lab-04-solution` | After Lab 4: FastAPI model serving                  |
| `lab-05-solution` | After Lab 5: Docker containerisation                |
| `lab-06-solution` | After Lab 6: Advanced CI/CD pipeline                |
| `lab-07-solution` | After Lab 7: Full MLOps pipeline                    |

If you get stuck on a lab, check out the previous solution branch to see the working starting point:
```bash
git checkout lab-02-solution
```

## Running individual modules

```bash
# Train only
python -m src.train

# Evaluate only (requires a trained model)
python -m src.evaluate

# Run tests with coverage output
pytest tests/ -v
```
